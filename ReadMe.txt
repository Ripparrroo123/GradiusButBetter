Basic controls:
Use W, A, S, and D or the arrow keys to move.
Use the Spacebar to shoot.

Special Moves:
Rapidly tap the Spacebar to shoot slightly stronger bullets. These can be shot as fast as you tap, so they can be very powerful if you're quick.
Hold the Spacebar until the player becomes red, then release the Spacebar to fire a large, very powerful shot.

Your goal:
Survive as long as you can and earn points by destroying enemies and bosses.
